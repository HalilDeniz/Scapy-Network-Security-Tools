# Scapy Network Security Tools

Welcome to the **Scapy Network Security Tools** repository! This repository contains 10 powerful tools designed for network analysis, penetration testing, and security testing. Each tool leverages Python and Scapy to manipulate or inspect network traffic, helping you to better understand network behavior, identify vulnerabilities, and test security mechanisms.

Whether you're a cybersecurity professional, network administrator, or just curious about how network protocols work, these tools provide valuable insights into network traffic and vulnerabilities.

#### Tools Included:
1. **Network Traffic Monitoring Tool:** his tool monitors all incoming and outgoing network traffic on a specified interface. It identifies and categorizes traffic based on protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP, providing real-time monitoring for deeper network insights.
2. **Port Scanner:**  simple yet effective port scanner that checks for open TCP and UDP ports on a target IP address. It's a fundamental tool for understanding network services and identifying potential attack vectors.
3. **DNS Spoofing Simulation:** his tool simulates a DNS spoofing (or DNS cache poisoning) attack. It sends forged DNS responses to redirect victims to a malicious IP address, useful for testing DNS security.
4. **ARP Spoofing Tool:** erforms an ARP spoofing attack by intercepting and manipulating network traffic between a victim and the network gateway, commonly used for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
5. **TCP SYN Flood Attack Simulation:** imulates a TCP SYN flood attack to test how servers respond to being overwhelmed with incomplete TCP connection requests. This tool can be used to understand how DoS attacks operate.
6. **ICMP Ping Sweep:**  simple network discovery tool that sends ICMP echo requests (pings) to identify live hosts within a specified IP range. Useful for mapping out networks.
7. **Wi-Fi Packet Injection Tool:** his tool injects crafted packets into a Wi-Fi network, allowing for attacks such as deauthentication. It’s an essential tool for wireless network security testing.
8. **Traceroute Tool:** aps the path taken by packets to reach their destination by sending packets with incrementally increasing TTL values. This tool helps in diagnosing network routing issues.
9. **SSH Traffic Detection Tool:** onitors for SSH traffic on a network by detecting packets sent over port 22, the default port for SSH connections. This tool can be useful for detecting unauthorized SSH access.
10. **Packet Manipulation Tool:** Captures network traffic in real-time, allows for modification of packets, and then re-injects them into the network. This tool demonstrates how packet manipulation can be used in both attack and defense scenarios.
